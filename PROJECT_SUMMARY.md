## 3. Architecture and Structure

### Application Structure
The application follows a modular, component-based architecture with clear separation of concerns:

```
src/
├── components/     # Reusable UI components
├── pages/          # Page-level components
├── context/        # React context for state management
├── hooks/          # Custom React hooks
├── services/       # API and external service integrations
├── types/          # TypeScript type definitions
├── utils/          # Utility functions
├── data/           # Mock data and static assets
├── lib/            # Library configurations and helpers
├── firebase/       # Firebase configuration and initialization
└── styles/         # CSS modules and styling
```

### Key Architectural Patterns
- **Component-Based Architecture**: Modular UI components with single responsibilities
- **Context API**: State management for user data, settings, and authentication
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated logic for reusable functionality (favorites, resorts, etc.)
- **Type-Safe Development**: Comprehensive TypeScript interfaces for all data structures
- **Service Layer**: Separated API calls and external service integrations
- **Firebase Integration**: Centralized configuration for authentication and database operations

### State Management Approach
- **React Context**: Used for global state (user, settings, authentication)
- **SWR**: Data fetching, caching, and revalidation for remote data
- **Local Component State**: Managed with useState for UI-specific state
- **Custom Hooks**: Encapsulated state logic for complex features (favorites, filtering)

## 4. Current State of Development

### Completed Features
- **Authentication System**: Login, registration, and user session management
- **Interactive Map**: Mapbox integration with resort markers and filtering
- **Resort Discovery**: Comprehensive resort information with images and details
- **Trip Planning**: Multi-step trip builder with resort selection, dates, and accommodation
- **User Account**: Profile management, preferences, and settings
- **Favorites System**: Save and filter preferred resorts
- **Weather Integration**: Current conditions and forecasts for resorts
- **Responsive Design**: Mobile-first approach with bottom navigation

### Demo/Placeholder Elements
- **Mock Resort Data**: Three demo resorts (Sugar Mountain, Steamboat Springs, Vail) with comprehensive information
- **Mock Hotel Data**: Accommodation options for each demo resort
- **Placeholder Services**: Some features use mock data while awaiting backend integration
- **Demo Mode Toggle**: Switch between demo and real data for presentations
- **Transportation Step**: Placeholder for future transportation booking features

### Technical Debt
- **Firebase Transition**: Mixed use of Firestore and Realtime Database during migration
- **Mock Data Dependencies**: Some components rely on mock data that needs to be replaced with API calls
- **Error Handling**: Inconsistent error handling patterns across components
- **Performance**: Map rendering and filtering could be optimized for large datasets
- **Testing**: Limited test coverage for components and utilities

## 5. Notable Patterns and Approaches

### UI/UX Patterns
- **Mobile-First Design**: Optimized for mobile devices with progressive enhancement
- **Bottom Navigation**: Fixed navigation bar for easy thumb access on mobile
- **Card-Based Layouts**: Consistent card components for displaying resort and accommodation information
- **Progressive Disclosure**: Complex information revealed through step-by-step interfaces
- **Loading States**: Consistent loading indicators for async operations
- **Modal Overlays**: For detailed resort information and forms

### Code Organization
- **Feature-Based Structure**: Components organized by feature (explore, plan, account)
- **Index Files**: Clean imports through index files in component directories
- **Custom Hooks**: Reusable logic extracted into custom hooks
- **Type Definitions**: Centralized type definitions for consistent data structures
- **Utility Functions**: Shared utilities for common operations (filtering, formatting)
- **Service Layer**: Separated business logic from UI components

### Type Safety
- **Comprehensive Interfaces**: Detailed TypeScript interfaces for all data models
- **Strict Configuration**: Strict TypeScript settings for maximum type safety
- **Prop Types**: All components have defined prop interfaces
- **API Response Types**: Typed responses from external services
- **Error Handling**: Typed error objects for consistent error management
